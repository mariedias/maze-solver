# Maze Solver
This Java code implements a maze solver algorithm. ðŸ•¹
<br><br>
It takes a maze as input, where 'X' represents walls, 'D' is the exit (destiny), the starting point is always at (0, 0) of the array, the path is represented as empty spaces ' ', and the path that's already visited is marked with 'V'.<br> 
The code finds a path from the starting point to the exit by navigating through the maze and marking the visited path.
